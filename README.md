# Merplings!


# Magic

There will be two types of magic! One is blood magic which allows you to summon demons. The other is just regular spells really like magic missle things like that. The catch which the normal spells is that you have to physical type out the spell in order to use it. 

# Merplings

Merplings are a type of entity that are like villagers but are very self sufficient. They can mine, craft, and build. Giving them topaz along with specific items can allow you to get special spells on your swords and tools. There will also be a reputation system so try your best not to mess with them.
